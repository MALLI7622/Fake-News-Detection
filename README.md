Fake News Detection in Binary and Six-way Classification
I'm one of the Facebook Secure and Private AI Scholar. I had done a project on Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I had done Binary Classification and as well as six-way classification using different Machine Learning Classifiers they are

Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
Passive Aggressive Classifier
Support Vector Classifier
Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
By training and testing repeatedly I had got Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier is best for Binary Classification. And Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier is best for six-way classification.
My project was helpful in finding Fake News during elections or campaigns in Social Media or News Channels.
